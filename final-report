The Battle of Neighborhoods in Novi Sad by Zoran Kocevski

Business Problem: In the city Novi Sad in Serbia, if someone is looking to open a restaurant/gym/spa, 
where would you recommend that they open it? 

Data: We will use a csv file with list of all areas in Novi Sad and their coordinates which help us to use 
Foursquare. We generated this csv file using data from Wikipedia.

Explanation of work flow: 
- Download all the dependencies that we will need.
- Tranform the data into a pandas dataframe
- Define Foursquare Credentials and Version
- Create a function to repeat the same process to all the neighborhoods in Novi Sad
- Create a new dataframe called df_venues filled using the above function on each neighborhood
- Analyze Each Neighborhood
- Group rows by neighborhood and by taking the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each category
- Create the new dataframe and display the top 10 venues for each neighborhood
- Cluster Neighborhoods using 5 as number of clusters and methodology K-means
- Visualize the resulting clusters

Results: You can find as part of Examine Clusters in notebook

Recommendation: 
- If someone is looking to open a restaurant the best areas are: Salajka and Grbavica
- If someone is looking to open a spa the best areas are all except Adamovicevo Naselje
- If someone is looking to open a gym the best areas are all except Stari Grad

Conclusion:
This is a report with small of number input paramaters. If we would like to create a better report we should include 
more input parameters like budget of specific area, population for specific area, infrastructure of specific area and so on.
